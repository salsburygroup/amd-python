# Visual Statistics
The two python scripts here generate an image of a biopolymer with uncertainty in position shown as shadow.

The script VMDsigma.py creates a folder for each cluster up to the last cluster specified with "-l". The two pdb files within each folder are then the inputs of "--middle" and "--shadow". for vdistribution.py. Use "-h" for more details.
